## Cost Considerations

### Estimated Monthly Costs by Lab

| Lab | Resources | Est. Cost (USD) | Free Tier Eligible |
|-----|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Lab 01** | VPC, ASG, RDS, ALB | $50-80 | Partially |
| **Lab 02** | + EKS cluster | $120-180 | No |
| **Lab 04** | + Monitoring stack | $140-200 | No |
| **All Labs** | Complete platform | $200-300 | No |

### Cost Optimization Strategies

#### For Learning/Development
```bash
# Scale resources to minimum
terraform apply -var="desired_capacity=1" -var="instance_type=t3.micro"

# Use single AZ for non-HA scenarios  
terraform apply -var="availability_zones=[\"us-west-2a\"]"

# Clean up when not in use
make destroy  # Per lab
./tools/cleanup.sh  # All labs
```

#### For Production Reference
- Use Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
- Implement auto-scaling policies for cost optimization
- Regular right-sizing analysis with AWS Cost Explorer
- Tagging strategy for cost allocation and tracking

### Budget Alerts

Set up AWS Budget alerts to prevent unexpected charges:

```bash
# Create a budget alert (one-time setup)
aws budgets create-budget \
  --account-id $(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text) \
  --budget file://budget-alert.json
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

#### AWS CLI Not Configured
```bash
# Error: Unable to locate credentials
# Solution: Configure AWS CLI
aws configure
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

#### Insufficient Permissions
```bash
# Error: User: arn:aws:iam::xxx:user/xxx is not authorized
# Solution: Attach required policies to your IAM user
# See Prerequisites section for required permissions
```

#### Tool Version Conflicts
```bash
# Error: Terraform version is incompatible
# Solution: Update to required version
terraform --version  # Check current version
# Install latest from: https://terraform.io/downloads
```

#### Port Conflicts
```bash
# Error: Port already in use
# Solution: Check what's using the port
lsof -i :8080
# Kill the process or use different port
```

### Lab-Specific Issues

#### Terraform State Conflicts
```bash
# Error: Error acquiring the state lock
# Solution: Force unlock (use carefully)
terraform force-unlock <lock-id>

# Or check DynamoDB table for stuck locks
aws dynamodb scan --table-name devops-studio-terraform-locks
```

#### AWS Resource Limits
```bash
# Error: Service quota exceeded
# Solution: Check current limits
aws service-quotas get-service-quota \
  --service-code ec2 \
  --quota-code L-34B43A08  # Running On-Demand instances

# Request quota increase if needed
```

#### Cost Overruns
```bash
# Emergency cleanup all resources
./tools/cleanup.sh

# Check for running resources
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[?State.Name==`running`]'
aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[?DBInstanceStatus==`available`]'
```
